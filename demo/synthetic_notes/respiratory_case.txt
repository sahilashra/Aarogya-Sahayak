General: Appears dyspneic, using accessory muscles of respiration, speaking in short sentences
HEENT: No cyanosis, pursed-lip breathing noted
Neck: No jugular venous distension, no lymphadenopathy
Cardiovascular: Tachycardic, regular rhythm, no murmurs
Respiratory: Bilateral expiratory wheezes throughout lung fields, prolonged expiratory phase, decreased breath sounds in lower zones, no crackles
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly
Extremities: No clubbing, no edema, no cyanosis

LABORATORY FINDINGS:
Arterial Blood Gas (room air): pH 7.36, PaCO2 48 mmHg, PaO2 58 mmHg, HCO3 26 mEq/L
Complete Blood Count: WBC 12,500/μL with neutrophilia, Hemoglobin 14.2 g/dL, Platelets 245,000/μL
Chest X-ray: Hyperinflation, flattened diaphragms, no acute infiltrates, no pneumothorax
Sputum: Purulent appearance, culture pending
Spirometry (from 3 months ago): FEV1 58% predicted, FEV1/FVC ratio 0.62

ASSESSMENT:
Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), likely infectious etiology. Patient has moderate COPD with acute worsening requiring intensified bronchodilator therapy and systemic corticosteroids.

PLAN:
1. Admit to medical ward for monitoring and treatment
2. Oxygen therapy via nasal cannula to maintain SpO2 88-92%
3. Nebulized Salbutamol 2.5mg and Ipratropium 0.5mg every 4 hours
4. Oral Prednisolone 40mg once daily for 5 days
5. Antibiotic therapy - Amoxicillin-Clavulanate 625mg three times daily for 7 days
6. Continue Tiotropium 18mcg inhaler once daily
7. Continue Amlodipine for hypertension
8. Chest physiotherapy and breathing exercises
9. Smoking cessation counseling (patient and household members)
10. Nutritional assessment and supplementation if needed
11. Pulmonary rehabilitation referral after acute episode resolves
12. Pneumococcal and influenza vaccination status to be reviewed
13. Consider long-term oxygen therapy assessment if hypoxemia persists
14. Follow-up spirometry in 6 weeks after recovery
15. Discharge planning with inhaler technique education and action plan for future exacerbations

PATIENT EDUCATION PROVIDED:
Discussed COPD exacerbation triggers, importance of medication adherence, proper inhaler technique, and smoking cessation. Explained warning signs of worsening condition requiring immediate medical attention. Emphasized need for pulmonary rehabilitation and regular follow-up. Patient and family verbalized understanding of treatment plan and agreed to smoking cessation support.
